I will be teaching my friends how to program a bot, written in JavaScript and Node.js, that trades stocks under certain conditions.

# Pre-requisites
* you DO NOT need to know how to program to follow this tutorial.
* Node.js and NPM installed
*  -Node.js > https://nodejs.org/en/
*  -NPM > Choose in custom setup after double clicking the Node.js installer
* A text editor such as VisualStudio Code or Atom.io
* I had my friends use Atom.io

# Optional but recommended
* I will teach the basics of git, a version control system.
* It is recommended that you use version control with all of your projects.
* So.. start here lol
